What does mild depression feel like?

Mild depression involves more than just feeling blue temporarily.
Your symptoms can go on for days and are noticeable enough to interfere with your usual activities.


Mild depression may cause:
- irritability or anger

- hopelessness

- feelings of guilt and despair

- self-loathing
- 
a loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed
- 
difficulties concentrating at work
- 
a lack of motivation
- 
a sudden disinterest in socializing
- 
aches and pains with seemingly no direct cause
- 
daytime sleepiness and fatigue

- insomnia
- 
appetite changes

- weight changes
- 
reckless behavior, such as abuse of alcohol and drugs, or gambling


If your symptoms persist for most of the day, on an average of four days a week for two years, you would most likely be diagnosed with persistent depressive disorder. 
This condition is also referred to as dysthymia.

Though mild depression is noticeable, it’s the most difficult to diagnose.
It’s easy to dismiss the symptoms and avoid discussing them with your doctor.

Despite the challenges in diagnosis, mild depression is the easiest to treat.
Certain lifestyle changes can go a long way in boosting serotonin levels in the brain, which can help fight depressive symptoms.



Helpful lifestyle changes include:


- exercising daily
- 
adhering to a sleep schedule

- eating a balanced diet rich in fruits and vegetables
- 
practicing yoga or meditation
- 
doing activities that reduce stress, such as journaling, reading, or listening to music


Other treatments for mild depression include alternative remedies, such as St. John’s Wort and melatonin supplements. However, supplements can interfere with certain medications. Be sure to ask your doctor before taking any supplements for depression.

A class of antidepressants called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may be used in some cases. However, these tend to be more effective in people with more severe forms of depression. Recurrent depression tends to respond better to lifestyle changes and forms of talk therapy, such as psychotherapy, than medication.

While medical treatment may not be needed, mild depression won’t necessarily go away on its own. In fact, when left alone, mild depression can progress to more severe forms.
