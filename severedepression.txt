What does severe (major) depression feel like?



Severe (major) depression is classified as having the symptoms of mild to moderate depression, but the symptoms are severe and noticeable, even to your loved ones.



Episodes of major depression last an average of six months or longer. Sometimes severe depression can go away after a while, but it can also be recurrent for some people.



Diagnosis is especially crucial in severe depression, and it may even be time-sensitive.



Major forms of depression may also cause:


- delusions

- feelings of stupor

- hallucinations

- suicidal thoughts or behaviors


Severe depression requires medical treatment as soon as possible. Your doctor will likely recommend an SSRI and some form of talk therapy.



If you’re experiencing suicidal thoughts or behaviors, you should seek immediate medical attention. Call your local emergency services or the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-8255 right away.
