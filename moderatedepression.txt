What does moderate depression feel like?



In terms of symptomatic severity, moderate depression is the next level up from mild cases. Moderate and mild depression share similar symptoms. 

Additionally, moderate depression may cause:


- problems with self-esteem

- reduced productivity

- feelings of worthlessness

- increased sensitivities

- excessive worrying


The greatest difference is that the symptoms of moderate depression are severe enough to cause problems at home and work.You may also find significant difficulties in your social life.



Moderate depression is easier to diagnose than mild cases because the symptoms significantly impact your daily life. The key to a diagnosis, though, is to make sure you talk to your doctor about the symptoms you’re experiencing.



SSRIs, such as sertraline (Zoloft) or paroxetine (Paxil), may be prescribed. These medications can take up to six weeks to take full effect. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is also used in some cases of moderate depression.
